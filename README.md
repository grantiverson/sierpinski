# Sierpinski's Triangle Generator: Probability Exercise

I got the idea for this program from a math textbook called Discovering Algebra. In one of the activities, students are encouraged to draw a triangle, associate each triangle with two of the numbers of a die, and then perform a simple algorithm to draw dots on the triangle. The algorithm requires students to 1) pick a random point on the triangle, 2) role a die, then 3) mark the midpoint of the previously drawn point and the triangle vertex corresponding to the number on the die, repeating steps 2 and 3 over and over.

I did it with JavaScript instead.

## Run live

~Run it live at [iverson.io/projects/sierpinski](https://iverson.io/projects/sierpinski)~

### How it works

This is more of an exercise in the usefulness of computers in probability than a game or application, as it is not very interactive. The only interactivity is that the vertices of the big triangle can be dragged around to change its shape. Notice that the programming regenerates the pattern using the algorithm described above.

This fractal pattern of recurring triangles is known as [Sierpinski's Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle).
